## Background

<span class="background">Recently I was tasked with finding a cloud native solution that would allow incoming URL requests to be redirected to another URL destination. The cloud native solution had to be cost effective, require minimal configuration, and handle hundreds of request per day. 

Enter Azure Functions.

Azure Functions are defined by Microsoft as the following:

*"Azure Functions is a cloud service available on-demand that provides all the continually-updated infrastructure and resources needed to run your applications. You focus on the pieces of code that matter most to you, and Functions handles the rest"*

Simply put, Azure Functions allow us to write code without worrying about the underlying hardware on which the code runs on.
